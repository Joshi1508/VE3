The Django Data Analyzer Web Application is a small project that provides a user-friendly tool for uploading CSV files, conducting data analysis, and visualizing results on a web interface.

Prerequisites:

The prerequisites for running the Django Data Analyzer Web Application include:

Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Django: Install the Django web framework.
Pandas: Install the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Install the NumPy library for numerical computations.
Matplotlib or Seaborn: Install either Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization.
These prerequisites are necessary to set up the development environment and run the application successfully.

Installations:
Django Installation:- pip install django
Pandas: pip install pandas
Numpy: pip install numpy
matplotlib: pip install matplotlib


How to run:
-Run the Development Server: python manage.py runserver
-Copy the url from terminal i.e- http://127.0.0.1:8000

How it works:

How the Django Data Analyzer Web Application Works
File Upload:

Users upload CSV files through a form provided by the application.
The uploaded files are stored temporarily for processing.
Data Processing:

Upon file upload, the application reads the CSV file using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python.
Basic data analysis tasks are performed, including displaying the first few rows of the data, calculating summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns, and identifying and handling missing values.
Data Visualization:

Matplotlib or Seaborn, integrated with Pandas, is used to generate basic plots such as histograms for numerical columns based on the processed data.
The generated plots are displayed on the web page along with the analysis results.
